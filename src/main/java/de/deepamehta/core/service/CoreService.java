/**
 * Specification of the DeepaMehta core service -- the heart of DeepaMehta.
 * <p>
 * The responsibility of the DeepaMehta core service is to orchestrate the control flow and allow plugins to hook in.
 * The main duties of the DeepaMehta core service are to provide access to the storage layer and to trigger hooks of
 * the registered plugins.
 * <p>
 * The DeepaMehta core service is a realization of the <i>Inversion of Control</i> pattern.
 * <p>
 * The DeepaMehta core service provides methods to deal with topics, relations, types, commands, and plugins.
 * <p>
 * Plugin developer notes: Inside the {@link Plugin} and {@link Migration} classes an instance of the DeepaMehta
 * core service is available through the <code>dms</code> object.
